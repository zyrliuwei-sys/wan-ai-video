# Step 7 — Legal pages

## Goal

Remove placeholders and make contact/domain consistent.

## Files

- `content/pages/privacy-policy.mdx`
- `content/pages/terms-of-service.mdx`
- `content/pages/privacy-policy.zh.mdx` (if present)
- `content/pages/terms-of-service.zh.mdx` (if present)

## Replacements

- `YourAppName` → **projectName**
- `your-domain.com` → **domain**
- `support@your-domain.com` → **socialLinks.supportEmail** (or `support@{domain}`)

## Constraints

- Keep structure and tone.
- Do not add unusual promises or claims.
- If you cannot produce good legal Chinese, keep ZH pages minimally edited but correct.
